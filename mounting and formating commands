************ FORMATING & MOUNTING ************


#Act of mounting a storage volume is essentially attaching it to a folder on the file system
#/etc/fstab, its going mount everything that included in file line by line when booting. so, if you have a hard disk and you wanted to mounted automatically when booting, add it here.

$lsblk  or  $sudo fdisk -l     -     gives you a list of block devices that are connected to linux workstation or server
$mount     -      list all mounted storage devices on system
$sudo umount [MOUNTPOINT]      -     to unmount the device from mountpoint 
$sudo fdisk /dev/sdb       -        run that against the device that we want to create a file system on (to make partional table(GPT,MBR) and partionas on that device)
$sudo mkfs.exfat -n "label" /dev/sdb       -       allow us to format the partition with whatever filesystem type we want(/dev/sdb = device) (exfat = filesystem)
$df -h       -       shows you how much space is used up on any of the mounted file system
$sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/disk2/      -     mount the /dev/sdb device to /mnt/disk2 floder 
$mount /dev/cdrom /mnt      -        /dev/cdrom is the device that needs to be mounted. Usually, a mountable device is found inside the /dev folder. /mnt is the destination folder to mount the device to.
                                     When I say mount, it means that weâ€™ll connect the device to a folder so we can access the files from our filesystem. The default syntax to mount a filesystem is below:
$sudo ncdu  [path_from _where_to_start]     -     to check disk uasge(it is a tool that is usefull when you are running out of space) (-x=to exclude attached file system)
$du /home/user/Documents         -        to check how much space a file or a directory takes up (option=-smkh)
